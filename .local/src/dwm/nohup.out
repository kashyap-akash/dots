                                  --unredir-if-possible, and possibly others. 
                                  You need to turn this on manually if you want 
                                  to match against rounded_corners in 
                                  conditions.
        --detect-client-opacity   Detect _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY on client 
                                  windows, useful for window managers not 
                                  passing _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY of client 
                                  windows to frame
        --vsync                   Enable VSync

                                  monitor to that monitor. This is currently 
                                  implemented using the X RandR extension
        --use-ewmh-active-win     Use _NET_WM_ACTIVE_WINDOW on the root window 
                                  to determine which window is focused instead 
                                  of using FocusIn/Out events
        --unredir-if-possible     Unredirect all windows if a full-screen 
                                  opaque window is detected, to maximize 
                                  performance for full-screen applications.
        --focus-exclude=COND      Specify a list of conditions of windows that 
                                  should always be considered focused.
        --inactive-dim-fixed      Use fixed inactive dim value.
        --detect-transient        Use WM_TRANSIENT_FOR to group windows, and 
                                  consider windows in the same group focused at 
                                  the same time.
        --detect-client-leader    Use WM_CLIENT_LEADER to group windows, and 
                                  consider windows in the same group focused at 
                                  the same time. This usually means windows 
                                  from the same application will be considered 
                                  focused or unfocused at the same time. 
                                  WM_TRANSIENT_FOR has higher priority if 
                                  --detect-transient is enabled, too.
        --blur-background         Blur background of semi-transparent / ARGB

                                  frame is not opaque. Implies 
                                  --blur-background.
        --blur-background-fixed   Use fixed blur strength instead of adjusting 
                                  according to window opacity.

                                  mode. If omitted or is 0, the whole screen is 
                                  repainted.
        --blur-background-exclude=COND  
                                  Exclude conditions for background blur.

                                  Conditions of windows that shouldn't be 
                                  considered full-screen for unredirecting 
                                  screen.
        --unredir-if-possible-delay  
                                  Delay before unredirecting the window, in 
                                  milliseconds. Defaults to 0.
        --write-pid-path=PATH     Write process ID to a file.
        --xrender-sync-fence      Additionally use X Sync fence to sync 
                                  clients' draw calls. Needed on nvidia-drivers 
                                  with GLX backend for some users.

                                  Do not fade destroyed ARGB windows with WM 
                                  frame. Workaround bugs in Openbox, Fluxbox, 
                                  etc.
        --force-win-blend         Force all windows to be painted with 
                                  blending. Useful if you have a custom shader 
                                  that could turn opaque pixels transparent.
        --version                 Print version number and exit.
        --log-level               Log level, possible values are: trace, debug, 
                                  info, warn, error
        --log-file                Path to the log file.
        --use-damage              Render only the damaged (changed) part of the 
                                  screen
        --no-use-damage           Disable the use of damage information. This 
                                  cause the whole screen to beredrawn every 
                                  time, instead of the part of the screen that 
                                  has actually changed. Potentially degrades 
                                  the performance, but might fix some 
                                  artifacts.
        --no-vsync                Disable VSync

                                  dimming)
        --transparent-clipping    Make transparent windows clip other windows 
                                  like non-transparent windows do, instead of 
                                  blending on top of them
        --transparent-clipping-exclude=COND  
                                  Specify a list of conditions of windows that

                                  applied. Useful for screenshot tools, where 
                                  you need to be able to see through 
                                  transparent parts of the window.
        --blur-method             The algorithm used for background bluring.

                                  convolution blur with --blur-kern. Note: 
                                  'gaussian' and 'box' is not supported by 
                                  --legacy-backends.
        --blur-size               The radius of the blur kernel for 'box' and

                                  When > 0, the compositor will round the 
                                  corners of windows. (defaults to 0).
        --rounded-corners-exclude=COND  
                                  Exclude conditions for rounded corners.

                                  radii.

                                  not paint a shadow over, such as a dock 
                                  window.
        --window-shader-fg=PATH   Specify GLSL fragment shader path for 
                                  rendering window contents. Does not work when

                                  in which case the default shader will be 
                                  used. Does not work when --legacy-backends is 
                                  enabled. See man page for more details
        --dithered-present        Use higher precision during rendering, and 
                                  apply dither when presenting the rendered 
                                  screen. Reduces banding artifacts, but might 
                                  cause performance degradation. Only works 
                                  with OpenGL.
        --no-frame-pacing         Disable frame pacing. This might increase the 
                                  latency.
        --legacy-backends         Use deprecated version of the backends.

        --diagnostics             Print diagnostic information
        --debug-mode              Render into a separate window, and don't take 
                                  over the screen. Useful when you want to
